### Blank Page Issue
If you see a blank page when opening `index.html`:
- Use `standalone.html` instead (this is the correct file for direct opening)
- The main `index.html` requires a build process and server

### File Upload Issues
- Ensure files are text-based (`.txt`, `.json`, `.md`, `.csv`)
- Check file size (recommended under 1MB for best performance)
- Use modern browsers with File API support

### Voice Features Not Working
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Use HTTPS or localhost for voice recognition
- Check browser compatibility for Speech APIs
